    <p class="box2-p">Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. [1]

            "Nature photography" overlaps the fields of -- and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography".[1]
            
            Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature's Best Photography. Well known nature photographers include Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, Frans Lanting, Galen Rowell, and Art Wolfe.</p>

                   <h3 class="wrapper1-title">Use of color</h3>
                   <p class="wrapper1-p"> Color images are not a requirement of nature photography. Ansel Adams is famous for his black-and-white depictions of nature, while Galen Rowell praised Fujifilm Velvia film for its bright, saturated colors. Both men distinguish between photography as an expressive art form and sensitometry; an accurate reproduction is not necessary.</p>

                    <h3 class="wrapper2-title">Macro and texture</h3>
                    <p class="wrapper2-p">The macro photography article explains close-up photography in general; however, this is also a type of nature photography. While common macro subjects – bees, dragonflies, and so on – could be described as wildlife, their world also makes for good photography.

                            Many photographers record images of the texture in a stone, tree bark, leaf, or any of other small scenes.
